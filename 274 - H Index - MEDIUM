274 - H Index - MEDIUM
Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper, return the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: The h-index is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given researcher has published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times.

Approach:
Sort the array and iterate from n-1 to 0

 

Example 1:

Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.

======================

public class Solution {
    public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
        int n = citations.length;
        int paper = 1;
        int h=0;
        
        Arrays.sort(citations);

        for(int i= n-1 ; i >= 0 ; i--){
            
            if(citations[i] >= paper && paper <=n){
                h= paper;
                paper++;

            }
                
        }

        return h;
    }
}

=======================



class Solution {
    public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
        Arrays.sort(citations);

        int n = citations.length;
        int hIndex = 0;

        //comparing the value with index -> i++ and n-- till the value and index are same
        //for [5,10,15,16,17] - 1st iteration -> 5 >= 5 , so the hindex becomes 5 
        //in case of [0,1,3,5,6 ] -> since previous values are lower than n-1 indices , we iterate
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (citations[i] >= n - i) {
                hIndex = n - i;
                break;
            }
        }

        return hIndex;
    }
}

//Creating a citation count array from 0 to length +1 -> 0 to 5
//1st step -> count = [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2]
public class Solution {
    public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
        int n = citations.length;
        int[] count = new int[n + 1];
        for (int citation : citations) {
            if (citation >= n) {
                count[n]++;
            } else {
                count[citation]++;
            }
        }

// i=5 , total < 5 ; i=4 , total < 4 ; i=3 , total >= 3 , hIndex = 3
        int total = 0;
        for (int i = n; i >= 0; i--) {
            total += count[i];
            if (total >= i) {
                return i;
            }
        }   
        return 0;
