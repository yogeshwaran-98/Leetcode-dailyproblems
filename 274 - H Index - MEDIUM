274 - H Index - MEDIUM
Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper, return the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: The h-index is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given researcher has published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times.

 

Example 1:

Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.

======================

class Solution {
    public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
        Arrays.sort(citations);

        int n = citations.length;
        int hIndex = 0;

        //comparing the value with index -> i++ and n-- till the value and index are same
        //for [5,10,15,16,17] - 1st iteration -> 5 >= 5 , so the hindex becomes 5 
        //in case of [0,1,3,5,6 ] -> since previous values are lower than n-1 indices , we iterate
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (citations[i] >= n - i) {
                hIndex = n - i;
                break;
            }
        }

        return hIndex;
    }
}
