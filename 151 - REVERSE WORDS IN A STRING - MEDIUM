151 - REVERSE WORDS IN A STRING - MEDIUM
Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"
===============

class Solution {
    public String reverseWords(String s) {
        String [] arr = s.trim().split("\\s+");
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for(int i=arr.length-1;i>=0;i--){
            
            sb.append(arr[i].trim()).append(" ");
        }
        return sb.toString().trim();
    }
}
