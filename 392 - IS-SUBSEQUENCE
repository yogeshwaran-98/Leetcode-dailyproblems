392 - IS-SUBSEQUENCE

Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
====================

class Solution {
    public boolean isSubsequence(String s, String t) {
        int sp =0 , tp =0;

        while(sp < s.length() && tp < t.length()){
            if(s.charAt(sp) == t.charAt(tp)){
                sp++;
                tp++;
            }else{
                tp++;
            }
        }

        return sp == s.length();

    }
}
